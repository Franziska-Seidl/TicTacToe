# Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game (Java)

About the Project

This project is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed as our first group project using Java. It was created as a practice exercise to help us learn the fundamentals of Java programming, including control structures, methods, input handling, and working with arrays.

The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe by entering numbers that correspond to positions on a 3x3 grid. The program checks for valid moves, identifies the winner, or ends the game in a draw.

Features:

  Two-player mode: Players alternate turns, using 'x' for Player 1 and 'o' for Player 2
  Input validation: Ensures input is between 1 and 9 and that the selected field is not already taken
  Dynamic game board: The board updates after each move and is printed to the console
  Win detection: The program checks all rows, columns, and diagonals after each move
  Draw condition: If all fields are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw

Technologies Used:

  Java – for all application logic
  Scanner – for reading user input from the console
  2D arrays – to store and update the game board
  Conditionals and loops – for input handling and game flow control


What We Learned:

This was our first collaborative programming project in Java. Through building this application, we learned how to:

  Use Java syntax and structure effectively
  Work with methods and return values
  Apply loops and conditions for game logic
  Structure a console application in a clean and logical way
  Collaborate as a team by dividing responsibilities and integrating code


How to Play:

  Run the program in your preferred Java IDE or terminal.
  The game board will be displayed with numbers 1 to 9 representing each position.
  Player 1 and Player 2 take turns entering a number to mark their symbol on the board.
  After each move, the program updates the board and checks for a winner.
  The game ends when a player wins or when all fields are filled with no winner (draw).
